### Predicting Extension, Flexural Stress and Strain Using Machine Learning

## 📜 **Problem Statement**
Flexural stress is a critical mechanical property in materials science, particularly for evaluating the strength of materials under bending loads. Accurately predicting Extension, flexural stress and strain based on input features such as load, can help in designing better materials and optimizing manufacturing processes.

🔹 **Objective:**
*  Build a machine learning model to predict Extension, flexural stress and strain based on an input feature.
*  Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like R² score and RMSE.
*  Analyze feature importance to understand which factors most influence flexural stress.

🔹 **Dataset Overview:**
The datset contains **2081 entries**, 0 to 2080 with the following key columns:
*  Time (s): Time in seconds.
*  Extension (mm): Change in sample length.
*  Load (kN): Applied force in kilonewtons.
*  Flexure stress (Mpa): Stress experienced by the material.
*  Flexure strain (%): Percentage strain.

🔹 **Methodology:**
We will use the following steps to solve the problem:
1. Data preprocessing
2. Model selection
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation
5. Feature importance
6. Visualization plots
7. Deployment
